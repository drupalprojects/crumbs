The ultimate breadcrumbs solution. Powerful, flexible, and as simple and DRY as can be.
(code will come soon)

Breadcrumbs based on:
- menus
- taxonomy
- system path fragments
- existing path alias fragments
- not yet existent pathauto alias fragments

Features:
- easy to extend.
- admin form to rearrange rules. no further configuration needed.
- guaranteed consistency: If you click on one link in the breadcrumb, this item's breadcrumb trail will be the respective sub-trail of the child trail.

Requirements:
- PHP 5.x

How it works:
A rule is an object that takes a path and returns a parent path.
If the rule returns NULL, the next rule is tried.

This process is repeated with the parent path, until either
- no further parent can be found.
- the returned path is the frontpage.
- the path is its own parent path.
- there is a loop consisting of more than one path.

In addition, every rule object has a chance to set a different title for a breadcrumb item (default is obtained from core menu system), or to let the item be skipped in the trail.
